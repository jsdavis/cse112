## Documentation

### Comments
All classes, fields, and methods are run through JSDoc. The basic formatting of JSDoc blocks can be seen in the example below:
```javascript
/**
 * Represents a book.
 * @constructor
 * @param {string} title - The title of the book.
 * @param {string} author - The author of the book.
 */
function Book(title, author) {
}
```
For more information on other types of tags, go to the JSDoc website [here](http://usejsdoc.org/).
